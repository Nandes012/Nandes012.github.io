# Limit
In my first class of calculus, i learn what is limit.
Limit is defined as a value that a function approaches the output for the given input values. Limits are important in calculus and mathematical analysis and used to define integrals, derivatives, and continuity.
In formulas, a limit of a function is usually written as

and is read as "the limit of f of x as x approaches c equals L". This means that the value of the function f can be made arbitrarily close to L, by choosing x sufficiently close to c. Alternatively, the fact that a function f approaches the limit L as x approaches c is sometimes denoted by a right arrow (→ or 
→), as in:

which reads "f of x tends to L as x tends to c"

# Limit and Functions
A function may approach two different limits. One where the variable approaches its limit through values larger than the limit and the other where the variable approaches its limit through values smaller than the limit. In such a case, the limit is not defined but the right and left-hand limits exist.

The limit of the function exists between any two consecutive integers.
