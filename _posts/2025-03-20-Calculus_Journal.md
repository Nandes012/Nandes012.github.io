# What i learn
In today's class i'm learning more about limit which is deritatives and chain rules about deritative

# Deritative
Deritative is a fundamental tool that quantifies the sensitivity to change of a function's output with respect to its input. The derivative of a function of a single variable at a chosen input value, when it exists, is the slope of the tangent line to the graph of the function at that point. The tangent line is the best linear approximation of the function near that input value. For this reason, the derivative is often described as the instantaneous rate of change, the ratio of the instantaneous change in the dependent variable to that of the independent variable. The process of finding a derivative is called differentiation.
A function of a real variable f(x) is differentiable at a point a of its domain, if its domain contain an open
interval containing a, and the limit

If the function f is differentiable at a, that is if the limit L exists, then this limit is called the derivative of
f at a. Multiple notations for the derivative exist. The derivative of f at a can be denoted f'(a), read as "f prime of a"; or it can be denoted df/dx(a) , read as "the derivative of f with respect to x at a" or "df by(over) dx at a"

# Chain rules of Deritative
In calculus, the chain rule is a formula that expresses the deritative of f and g. More precisely, if h = f â—‹ g is the function such that h(x) = f(g(x)) for every x, then the chain rule is, in Lagrange's notation
